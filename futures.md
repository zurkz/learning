# FUTURES


What is a futures contract?

Forward and futures contracts are financial instruments that allow market participants to offset or assume the risk of a price change of an asset over time. 

Transactions are taken place through a futures exchange.

A futures contract is a legally binding agreement to buy or sell an asset on a specific date or during a specific month. 

The only contract variable is the price. Price is discovered by bidding and offereing (also known as quoting) until a trade (or match) occurs.
