# Well Architected Framework notes

tools to help learn and apply AWS best pratices:
- AWS Well-Architected Framework Tool (AWS WA Tool)
- AWS Well-Architected Labs

Based on **five pillars**
1. Operational Excelllence
2. Security
3. Reliability
4. Performance Effiiciency
5. Cost Optimization

**Operational Excellence** - Ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures

**Security** - Ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies

**Reliability** - Ability of a system to recover form infrastructure of service disruptuons, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitiage disruption such as misconfigurations or transient network issues

**Performance Efficiency** - Ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evole

**Cost Optimization** - Ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point

#### Terms used in the Well-Architected Framework

- **component** - code, configuration, and AWS Resources that together deliver against a requirment. Often the unit of technical ownership and is decoupled from other components
- **workload** - a set of components that together deliver business value. Usually the level of detail that business and technology leaders communicate about
- **milestones** - mark key changes in your architecture as it evolves throughout the product lifecycle (design, testing, go live, and in production)
- **architecture** - how components work together in a workload. How components communicate and interact is often the focus of architecture diagrams
- **technology portfolio** - collection of workloads that are required for the business to operate

When architecting workloads you may have to make trade-offs between the pillars based upon your business context.

#### On Architecture

On-prem environments usually have a team for technology architecture composed of roles such as Technical Architect (infra), Solutions Architect (software), Data Architect, Networking Architect, and Security Architect.

AWS prefers to distribute capabilities into teams rather than having a centralized team with that capability. 

To ensure that these teams are meeting internal standards AWS has come up with **pratices** and **mechanisms**.
